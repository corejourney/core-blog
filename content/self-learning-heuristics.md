Here are some general tips that I have found useful as a student in high school. As I value my time great, I generally favour efficiency. By developing a sort of "routine" for studying I have found myself only spending 1-2 hours studying for any given test just by studying more efficiently.

(More geared towards STEM subjects)

### Determine what type of subject it is (Memorization Heavy vs Method Heavy)

Now every subject can generally be split into two categories. Some are memorization heavy (biology, chemistry) and others are method heavy (calculus, math).

### Shun Theory, Focus on Practice Problems
### Get good at categorizing practice problems
### Work on Your Weaknesses (Duh)
### Review early and often (Time investment save in the long run, Stay consistent)
### Determining what your grader wants (Professor marking preferences)
### Study with quick bursts (Don't overwork your mind)
### Good Sleep and Nutrition
