A list of platitudes that you can repeat to yourself like a crazy person to make life bearable. (real)

----

1. This is all temporary and a dream; It doesn't really matter if you're bad at living a dream.

2. Noone is forcing you to call yourself a loser, you know. 
      
3. You were only given this life because you are strong enough to live it.

4. Being ugly or unsightly is fine; just don't be incompetent along with it.

5. Being lonely or unsociable is fine; just don't be a total creep along with it.

6. Being untalented or ununique is fine; just don't be a lazy slob along with it.

7. Hating yourself is stupid because others will do it for you.

8. Sometimes people will love you for no reason and you just have to live with that. (and vice versa). 

9. Never expect nice round numbers.  

10. You have to learn Chinese. If you accomplish something else then good. If you aren't Chinese, that's good as well. But you have to learn Chinese.

11. You're going to regret something you're doing right now. So you might as well just do what you want.

12. Do not buy products you see on Tiktok or Instagram.

13. [Contradicting 7] It's fine to hate on yourself a little. Just as a treat.

14. Wanting money only makes sense if you're going to spend it on something useful.
    
15. Sit down. Lock in. Stop thinking about them. They don't see you in that way.

16. Sometimes being yourself is impossible. But that's okay. You can use this time to learn how to suffer.
    
17. If your family doesn't accept you, then you are kind of screwed. Sorry.

18. No one, and I mean no one, cares about your music taste. When someone asks you what music you like, they are more often than not trying to determine your personality.

19. If you drink more than 2 cups of coffee everyday, then you need to go on a caffine fast.

20. Only you know how to fill that emptiness. But you're going to need others to help.

21. You weren't put here to change or solve the world. You are here to live and experience it.

22. If you get up in the morning and skip breakfast, you can go for a good eight hours before realizing that you're hungry.

23. Go to sleep at a reasonable time. At least seven hours is a start. Or if you insist on burdening your waking hours, at least don't wallow in self pity afterwards.

24. Why do the most beautiful people on Earth drink exclusively warm water?
    
25. The body is a prison. But everyone escapes one day.

26. Ask yourself: Do the dead regret originally wishing to live? 
    
27. I should start being more positive for a change...

28. Most people don't really think like this because they dont need to. 

29. If people back then could live whole lives without a phone, you can find the strength to put it down just for an hour or two.

30. Praying is good and mostly beneficial. Even if you're an atheist, pray a little.

31. Don't say dumb blanket statements like 'Christianity is bad'. (Alternatively, don't be a redditor) 
    
32. Don't believe that you're above 'popular culture'. You're going to miss it someday. (Alternatively, don't be a redditor)
    
33. Don't belittle others for being basic. You are probably very basic as well. (Alternatively, don't be a redditor or tiktoker)
    
34. Doing a little daydreaming is okay, but only during physics class.

35. No one really operates on logic. Remember that. 
    
36. No one really follows their philosophy religiously. For all his preaching for being humble and one with nature, Marcus Aurelius is recorded to have led multiple punitive expeditions personally.
    
37. Don't do drugs and alcohol. Not because it's not fun or it's morally wrong, but because you can't afford to become even more unemployable.

Please send me more platitudes if you got them. I really like collecting them.
