So recently I revisited my "home country" after not having seen Chinese land for more than 7 years. 

I will spare you the trip details because they're irrelevant, but here are some observations I've made of this country and how it compares to other countries like Canada and the United States.

### 1. It is beautiful here.

The Design of Chinese Cities is generally far better at preserving the nature present. From what I've seen, this is because vegetation like trees or bushes are not confined into very specific blocks or wealthy neighbourhoods.

In Chinese cities you have the feeling that these places were designed to look good (and also feel good to live in) instead of being built in the cheapest possible way and just spilling concrete everywhere for parking lots like they do in Canada or the United States.

And of course, the natural scenery was also very nice. China is in general for more mountainous than Canada and America so it was nice to get a change of pace. Furthermore, tourist destinations like the Jiuzhaigou national park were also interesting and reminded me of Banff in Alberta because of the similarly bright blue water.

### 2. Smog is not nearly as bad as I remember

Smog is not that bad anymore. Before the air in major cities like could definitely be oppressive. Now it is not. How cool is that?

### 3. Food is EXTREMELY cheap here

Spending time in China is extremely eye-opening to people who don't know how much they're getting scammed by food prices in North America. For example,

A Big Mac Meal Combo from McDonalds in China is around **20 yuan**, which is around **3.84 CAD** (As of Jul. 2025) 

A Big Mac *(No Combo)* from McDonalds in Canada can go as high as **7 CAD**, which after tip and sales tax leaves us with a total of **8.7 CAD**.

So Canadian consumers are basically paying **double the amount to get half the food.** It really makes you question where all the money is going in Canada. ðŸ¤”

### 4. Public Transport is better here

In Qingdao they have Japanese-style subways with the sliding doors, along with extremely fast trains. They feel a lot more modern, are no where as shaky as Toronto's. The Subway lines also cover a far larger portion of the city, and are more numerous. 

Of course, the Qingdao metro has the benefit of having been built with modern design and technology whereas the TTC has to "work with what they got", but it is disappointing to see what Canadian cities could have if we didn't have corporate bureaucracy blocking every public works project ever.

### 1. EVERYTHING is online

Get ready to pull your phone out for the dumbest and needless things ever. Vendors on the street won't even take your cash to buy fruits anymore. It's all WeChat Pay now. 

Of course if you can't get access to any sort of online money system then prepare to suffer here.

I unfortunately did not take the time to spend time on any of the social media here but I'm sure it's far different from what I remember.

### 2. Feels like a surveillence state

China is definitely far more invasive than Western countries. They rely on Face ID far more for 'convenience' but the use of these technologies are unapologetically just an excuse to collect data to track people. This at times can feel almost violating.

For another example, China also randomly requires ID for extremely needless locations, such as being admitted to a museum for tickets. My family and I had to spend 20 minutes outside a museum once to input all the information from our passports. This probably results in the government having incredibly accurate information about every citizen, as a single mistake on a random form can be instantly detected.

So anyone who wants governments to stay out of their business should probably not consider going to China.

### 3. Wealth Disparity is stark and jarring at times

I used to be confused to as why China is labelled as a, 'developing country', but the inequality in development is actually incredibly clear. The modern apartment I resided in was in fact located right next to underdeveloped houses built decades ago.

This is a pattern everywhere I went in China. It's almost comical how you can tell which areas the money is going. Most tourist areas my family visited had locals communities which were clearly underfunded, located adjacent to resorts for tourists filled with Western businesses. But this seems to be quite standard for tourist areas everywhere.
