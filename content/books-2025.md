2025 was the year where I finally decided to "lock in" and start reading for real. So this year was mostly a question of determining the type of books I actually liked reading.

## How rating will work

As I do not really see myself as some sort of literary mastermind, I will rate the books on a simple scale of how much I enjoyed it. Here are the five ratings that I will utilize, from highest to lowest.

**1. Very Good, 2. Good, 3. Neutral, 4. Boring, 5. DNF (Did Not Finish)**

(Did Not Finish is not an evaluation on the books quality)

### The Drug Hunters (Kirsch, Donald)

I technically read this in December, but I included it because I thought it was fitting.

Drug Hunters is a book about medicine. Specifically, how new drugs are discovered, researched, and then released to the general public. It goes over the history of this practice, the discovery of crucial drugs such as acetaminophen, and the various problems that plague the industry.

The key insight that can be gathered from this book is that there is no real "method" when researching new drugs. The most popular drugs ever on the market were usually a result of dumb luck, (as is the case with penicillin), or alternatively, just modifications of an existing drug. As someone who was curious about pharmacology generally, I found these insights valueable, and also turned me off from pursuing this field of research generally, espicially with considering how new drugs are actually approved, and which get funding from pharmaceutical companies, which are topics also covered within the text.

I recommend reading this book if you're interested in how new drugs and treatments are researched (discovered), or if you want a crash course into the history of pharmaceuticals generally.

**RATING: Very Good**

### 活着 (余华)

我当时读这本书的时候是先想练习我的读中文的能力，并且更丰富了解中国文学方面的书。

“*活着*” 是我很久以来读的第一本书。因为我是在加拿大长大的，我读中文的时候会有一些困惑。（写文件也会有困惑 😄）但是令我吃惊的是，我读这本书其实没有什么大困难。

这个小说是一个忧伤和悲惨的故事。要是你读过这本书的话，这点你肯定知道。从这本书中，我得到很多启发。不仅有历史方面的，还有情感方面的。就算读不了中文，我推荐你读。 （好像一定会有英文版）

This is a deeply tragic and sad novel. Set in the midst of the transition from the Kuomintang to the Communist Party, it is about the story of Fugui. He is the son of a landlord turned peasant, and we follow the various misfortunes throughout his life. If you've read this before, you of course know this. 

Even if you are not Chinese, I think that it is worth reading. It is more about human tragedy, and how ordinary persevere through them, than anything else. (I believe there are English versions). 

**Rating: Very Good**

### No Longer Human (Dazai, Osamu)

The title directly translated from its Japanese original is *A Human Failure*. And honestly, I think that *A Human Failure* is a far more fitting title, because that is what the protagonist of the story, Yozo, precisely is. A semi auto-biographical novel, *No Longer Human* covers themes of alienation, depression and the fear of divine punishment.

If you enjoy reading about an insanely mentally damaged man who exploits every woman who ever has the misfortune of encountering him, while also somehow being the most self-loathing person ever (or you just *are* this kind of person, or maybe just relate to this kind of person), you will probably love reading this book.

A lot of negative reviews I've seen of this book has been focused on Yozo's behaviour itself. It's obvious that Yozo is a horrible, maybe insufferable person. It can be plainly seen by the way he wallows in misery, never improves his ways and is an obvious misogynist. However, it is obvious that he is not supposed to be an aspirational character, espicially with the context given in the epilogue. 

Osamu Dazai himself probably wrote Yozo as a sort of self insert, with this entire novel clearly being extremely personal to him. Dazai eventually died in a double suicide with his lover at the time, after multiple similar attempts. This is much like the attempted double suicide depicted within the story.

Read this book if you're in the mood for a depressing and slightly frustrating experience. (And if you can stomach the misogyny, of course).

**RATING: Good**
