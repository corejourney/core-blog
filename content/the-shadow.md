In the humble city of Toronto, there lived a teenager named 'X' who possessed countless dreams. Somewhat recently, X has been strangely chained within their own room, a situation created solely by X themselves.

Concerned and fearing death, X's shadow arose, saying, "Look at your pitiful state. Your condition is one of great misery and waste. May I ask why you have imprisoned yourself in this suffocating chamber of yours?"

Troubled, and occupied by illuminous LED lights, X replied, "Go away, Shadow! I am relaxing right now. You are disturbing me".

X's shadow sighed, shaking its head with great disappointment. "I trust that you know your dreams are wasting away. Every day you drown yourself in various amusements, accompanied by spiralling despair, yet every night you come to the same conclusion. That you are lost and tormented with abandoned aspirations. Confused, you flail your eyes around hectically like a mental patient, looking for some kind of guidance or saviour".

X was paying full attention now. With anxiety, X asked, "But what is there to do? My passions have long withered away, leaving only the shell. Happiness in such a state is impossible".

"No one can be as happy as they once were. Trying to relive happiness is foolish. If you continue down this path, then you are no different than a smoker, a caged zoo animal, and the naive who run from their own mortality. And I think that's a shame. I truly believe you could be anything you wanted be, if you didn't take yourself so fucking seriously".

"But what would happen if I fail? Shall I give up then?" X questioned.

"When you run away, I shall follow you close behind. When you fail, I shall tell you to try again another time. When you meander, I shall remind you that time is slowly creeping up on you, waiting to crush you and your ephemeral existence. And when you lament, I shall whisper to you: everything will be alright".

Fully convinced, X replied, "I understand. But what should I do first?"

Delighted, X's shadow quickly rose from the ground, answering, "Venture outside on this bright, cloudless sky. Turn around, look down and see that I have always been by your side. Only then, will our journey truly begin".
