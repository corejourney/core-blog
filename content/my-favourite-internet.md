#### It's been a while...

{{< figure src="/pics/my-favourite-internet/favimage.png" width="250px" height="auto" >}}

This image is truly remarkable, even at first glance. Initial viewers will correctly see an odd-looking fellow doing drugs off of a crushed soda can. One may even be concerned, as the form of the guy is clearly sickly and emanciated. Even more worryingly, they are hunched over in a bathroom that can only be described as liminal.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a desperation in our sickly subject's eyes. Something that would be uncharacteristic of a person who is getting high on some awesome party drugs. It is almost as if this image was sent as a final resort. Something one who has nowhere left to turn would post. After all, what could be the context of this supposed selfie? It doesn't look like a picture that would be sent to a friend, or posted on an instagram story. The inexplicable mystery behind the image further adds to the tenebrous aura of the piece.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still, there is a sort of surrealism in the picture, as there is reason to believe that it has been digitally altered. The ridiculously long nose, the multiple compression layers and filters added, all serve to make the image even stranger. Another queer observation is that it is unclear what is supporting the can in the photo. (if one hand is to be taking the selfie, then it follows that the other must be using the lighter). This therefore suggests that it is being held up by our subject's mouth, which raises a multitude of questions of which I will spare you of.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is most haunting about this photo is that the origin is unknown. Despite great effort I cannot find from whence it came. So out there is a poor, probably suffering drug addict whose moment of desperation now sits framed at my desk for me to appreciate and giggle at. Are they still alive? Are they still doing crazy drugs? Are they still emanciated? Do they love?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't answer these questions, and frankly I hope it stays that way.
