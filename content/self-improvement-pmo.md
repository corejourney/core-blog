Today I will be writing about some aspects about modern self-improvement content and if they are actually helping people. I believe that many of them promote a sort of illusion of change.

As I am talking more generally, not all self help content may be well described. If you believe that the content you consume does not apply to you, then good for you.

## the illusion of improvement

The modern culture of self-improvement is based off of the aesthetic of improvement than actual change. To be become "that person" who has almost everything figured out, to have that aura that no other person can replicate.

> If only I was beautiful, rich, popular, I wouldn't feel so awful...

Titles such as "How to fix yourself in 3 minutes or less", "Reinvent yourself to become the hottest person ever", and "Put yourself first to win in life instantly!" further reinforce what they are selling to people. 

**"Imagine yourself as the main character. Working so hard that you get everything you want. People will be begging just to spend a few minutes with you!"**

It's quite a self-obsessed mindset really. The whole industry promotes a sort of self-obsession. *"What can I gain?"*, *"What can I make more money?"*, *"What result does this bring to me?"*.

Results. Results. Results.

### the need to be "fixed"

The best target for self-improvement are people who are unsatisfied with their lives, one way or another. Because these people are easiest to convince that they are incomplete and require some kind of fix. It's easy to convince one who is down that they are the problem. 

**"Maybe if you can play the game of capitalism well enough you will be happy."**

It's quite convenient as well. After all, it's extremely easy to base worth around appearance, money, strength, relationships and sex because all of those things are easily quantifiable at a glance. 

**and honestly, I'm getting quite tired of being bombarded by some self-help guru trying to sell me needing a lambo, surgery or some garbage like that.**

### self-tyranny and loathing

At first, self-improvement may feel empowering and novel. Setting goals, putting more effort, and dreaming of a better future all feel great. However, this can go too far.

If one gets far too deep into self-help content, they will start adopting a philosophy of self-tyranny. To feel bad about wanting to "feel good", to feel bad about yourself for tripping, making mistakes, eating wrong. To start to loathe your own emotions, appearance, and imperfections.

> Omg why did I eat so much... why am I so broke... I'm such a loser! I'm supposed to be improving!

And at the same time, one will believe that this new state of mind represents self-improvement and growth. Forgetting the entire point of improvement, as improvement was never about becoming *perfect.*

### to improve

I believe that the purpose of improving oneself is to become more healthy. Whether mentally or physically.

Of course, this means that not all advice present in self help is bad and damaging. Eating well, getting enough sleep, prioritizing relationships are all good general advice that anyone can apply. And this is fairly obvious because if self help content gave zero good advice then none of them would get off the ground in the first place.

Point is, improvements are rarely visible, but they can be felt. Attempting to "fix yourself" is an impossible task, because there will always be parts missing in life. Life isn't a puzzle waiting to be completed, as corny as that sounds.

Actual improvement means making changes in mindset, getting rid of unhealthy habits and creating new ones, allowing for a more fulfilling, happier life. Not only for yourself, but equally importantly, for the people around you. People should not strive to be fixed — they should strive to lead lives worth living.

**Getting stacks of money won't fix your heart the same way a relationship won't fix your mind or self-confidence.**

Most material possessions are indeed quite meaningless.
