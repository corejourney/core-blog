I hate, and I mean *hate* when someone uses the phrase

> Biology says the main purpose of life is to reproduce, bro!!!

This phrase, and the family of glib expressions it belongs to, is always used disingenously to condescend towards people with alternative.

## first of all: It's not the purpose of life.

There are so many different "purposes of life" that I find much more compelling, at least compared to the "biological" sort of animalistic "reproductive" purpose that some may propose.

- Living for a cause
- Living for religion
- Living to enjoy life
- Living to improve the world
- Living for family
- Living to create art
- ...

These are all so much more valid and understandable purposes to dedicate a life to, and I'm sure that the same people who say this
 nonsense agree. People don't think about breeding on a day by day basis because no one dedicates their life to it, unless you're some kind of religious "*Be fruitful and multiply*" fundamentalist.

### and no, biology doesn't back up your point.

The idea that we have some kind of innate "biological purpose" is just simply absurd to me. This naturalistic view of life is not only grim, but just not backed up by anything beyond maybe heckin pop science, and espicially not biology. The theory of evolution is not a philosophical argument about the meaning of life or anything really, but a theory describing how heritable traits are passed down through multiple generations.

It can be argued that I am only alive typing these words today because my biological ancestors fulfilled their "biological purpose" and made the conditions just correct for me to exist.

But I really don't see it that way. When my parents birthed me, did they satisfy *some kind of nebulous biological purpose*? Did the  wooly mammoth *fail to meet some kind of purpose* just because it went extinct? No! The conditions were simply correct for my existence. All of us are here purely by coincidence. This coincidence of conditions, rather than being some kind of cosmic mission, can simply be observed and then explained by the theory of evolution.

### you don't actually believe that.

All those words to say, *you don't actually believe that statement*. I've noticed that this phrase is only repeated like some kind of automatic robotic response, when responding to someones lifestyle choices, mostly when someone wishes to be childless, or are in some kind of relationship where biological reproduction is impossible, such as a homosexual relationship.

*It isn't natural blah blah blah...*

Finding a lifestyle choice *such as choosing to be childless* odd is completely fine. Really. But one should be honest and just express such feelings. One  can even say that they'll never understand such a lifestyle. In a society where reproduction is very much the expectation, this can be an acceptable viewpoint. I do not think that it is worth it to pointlessly argue about others social values when they probably won't change anyways.

But I would much prefer honesty over a pseudoscientific one-liner which makes both of us feel like idiots.

### on lifestyle (short side note)

I think people nowadays are too quick to judge the lifestyles of others even when really, it doesn't matter. Lifestyle is a concern to people because it's an easy way to gesture some kind of morality (using only paper straws), even if it doesn't make a lot of sense (one person acting environmentally reponsible won't fix the global warming crisis). One's lifestyle in this age truly says so much about the person who follows it, and therefore, is a fitting target for policing.

"Biology says so" or "It's unnatural" is just one of the ways people police others lifestyle. I think that this type of judgement is everywhere nowadays, espicially around older folk and on the internet. So next time someone critizes your lifestyle, consider if it says something about *them* rather than the judgement purely being about you. 

Thank you for reading my rant.
