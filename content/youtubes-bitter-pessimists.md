So recently a noticable change of Youtube's algorithm has started to push smaller creators onto my recommended feed. Now most videos I get are cute little 'talk' style videos more reminiscent of older Youtube, among them I have discerned an interesting archetype of person that I felt the need to talk about.

So these videos usually have keywords like 'modernity', 'the truth about (blank)', '(blank) has failed (group of people)', '(blank) is over", always posted by some dude. I really think these videos represent what I find so annoying about much of internet culture nowadays.

## The Video

So while this genre of videos are plenty, I would like to focus on one which I felt was representative of this whole genre of person.

Now for this entire video, this gentleman depicted talks about a variety of subjects, often coming back to the idea of "truth". The main thesis, if you can call it that, is that modern society cares too much about viewing everything from a positive lens than truth.

### Conclusion

I will be slowly weaning myself off from Youtube and similar platforms. I would like to focus on stuff that I actually like instead of watching annoying people whom I do not really like.
