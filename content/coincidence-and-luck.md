## Background

Everything one has is mainly a result of luck.

Now this claim of mine is not a treatise proving the existance of fate, a justification for laziness, or criticism of aspiration for greatness. I am not suggesting defeatism. Rather, it is more of a simple reminder to be grateful and humble, even for aspects of life that are not initially thought of as priviledges to be thankful for.

### success and hard work

What initially spawned this thought of mine were two Tiktoks that I particularly disliked by a creator named Andrew, and I will explain my reaason for disliking them in a moment. I will now summarize each point this creator made in each of the points that Andrew makes, and I shall then go from there.

[Things to stop believing if you want to successful](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMBneptF6/)'s points: (No that is not my typo)

1. Don't believe that you're success is out of your control. 90% of success is determined by yourself.
   1. Justification: How does believing that luck determines success help you? It'll make you jealous, give up and become unmotivated.
2. Don't strive to be liked by a lot of people
3. Don't be afraid to bend or break rules

[Why most people are failures in life](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMBneqRKc/) points:

1. The majority of people are born with below-average potential.
   1. Justification: Some people are born with higher iq, richer family, better schools
2. Once you fall behind, it's incredibly hard to catch back up
3. People don't have the **correct motivation** to succeed


**I'm now getting word that this guy is ragebaitting goddamn it well**

- Everything in life and what we have is a coincidence/based on luck
- Not proving fate, or supporting the concept
- Nor does it seek to justify lazniness or critize the aspiration for greatness
- Simply a reminder to be grateful for what we have (what god has given us)
- Hard work is not the cost for success, it is the cost of the lottery ticket for success
- grindsets are for the priviledged
- we are prisoners accused of "not putting in the effort"
