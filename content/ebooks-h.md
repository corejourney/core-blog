In today's age, you cannot try to read (or do much of anything) without being forced to use some sort of e-book. Many textes can only be accessed online in fact. Here is why I refuse to read any book on a screen. (And why e-books aren't books)

## not everything has to be online, dood!
One of the worst consequences of the internet age is the attempted digitization of everything. *Everything* needs to be connected to the internet in some way. I am not a fan. There is no reason why something as basic as reading a book needs to be done on a computer screen.

### i spend enough time staring at computers!
Work is done on computers. School is done on computers. Socializing is done on computers. There is no escape from staring at a machine all day. There is no benefit to me staring at a computer screen for any additional hours of my life, having an objectively worse experience while reading. It is harder to focus. It wears your eyes. A e-book is a undeniably just a worse experience than reading a physical book.

## you don't even own the book you're reading.
When you buy a book on kindle/amazon, you are not buying a book. **You are not even paying for access to download the PDF file of the book**. You are buying permission to view the book on your account. You can't loan it. You can't store it. You can't resell it. You can't gift it. You can't pass it down. You have no real ownership of the book that you buy. 

> \>but e-books are cheaper than physical ones!

That may be true, but I do not see the worth of saving a few dollars just to have a worse experience. If you regret buying a physical book, you can often resell the book, espicially if it is a textbook.

### distractions

It is far easier to get distracted while reading a e-book. A device like a laptop or phone simply has way too much easy dopamine soyapps that demand your attention every single second. If you want to get *any* reading done, this is just another reason to just buy a book.

## build a real library.
**E-Books are worthless because you cannot hold it in your hand and flip through it.** You have no physical stake in that book. Although the information and words may be the same, it is not really a book as it lacks many aspects that make books special. I strongly believe you cannot claim ownership to a book if you do not own a physical copy.

In conclusion, I urge you to start buying physical books. You can make it fun. Make a list of your books like I have done [here](/library). Have fun!
