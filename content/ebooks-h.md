One annoying trend in the technology age is the push for everything to be done online. Here's why I still prefer buying physical books rather than buying technically cheaper e-books.

## problematic ownership

When you buy a e-book on a platform such as Kindle, you are not buying ownership. You are buying permission to view the book on your account. And what that really mean is that you can't loan e-books, store them, resell them, gift them, or really pass it down at all. You have no real ownership of the book that you buy. 

And to be honest, I don't see the purpose of spending money to buy access to a PDF that you can't even download.

### flaw: it's online

One of the worst consequences of the internet age is the attempted digitization of everything. Reading books online/on a screen comes with all the distractions and annoyances that come with it being online. Eye strain, constant distractions, even the act of opening an app can be troublesome and also annoying.

All of these disadvantages would be fine in my eyes if physical books made for an uncomfortable and inefficient experience, but that's really not true. It's far easier to get into reading a physical book in my opinion and that's just my experience reading. Perhaps its not a problem for people without attention spans completely brainrotted like mine.

### i already spend too much time online...

To be honest, the main reason why I dislike e-books is because it already extends my horribly long screen time. 

I used to cope and say that e-books were completely unusable but they aren't. E-books are a neccessary evil for authors who either can't afford to publish physical or people looking to read for cheap, so don't take my opinion as an attack on e-book readers.

#### **to be honest, i find e-book companies who basically gatekeep PDF files as a business model far more distasteful

For what its worth, buying physical has just made reading a far more enjoyable experience for me and if you share similar mindsets with me, I recommend doing the same.
