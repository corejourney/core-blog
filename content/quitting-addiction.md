Quitting whatever vice you are struggling with is **not hard**, espicially if it's a non-chemical one such as pornography, social media, video games, or self harm.

## What Addictions Really Are
In my view, addictions are really just a hobby that **significantly** negatively affects your life. Of course, you may not *describe* one as such due to social shame, but that is what it is. It is a recurring activity that is done for one's "enjoyment". This includes, drugs, video games, pornography, drinking, you name it.

### The wrong perspective when it comes to addiction
It is incorrect to see any addiction as adding no value to your life, because if that were true, you would have quit it immediately with no problem. Your addictions are a part of you whether you like it or not.

> \>But I reaaaaly want to quit [insert addiction here]

If that was true, you would have done it by now. But you haven't. Why? Because you aren't serious about quitting. Everytime you relaspe, everytime you make excuses for yourself, you are admitting that the benefit of relasping and falling back into addiction is worth more than *actually* quitting.

## My Personal Experience
I won't pretend that I was on hard drugs. But I did deal with my fair share of vices. One I would like the highlight is my previous video game addiction. Video games were not my biggest addiction by far but it is a good and relatable example. The game I played the most is actually embarassing to say. Get ready for it: it was *League of Legends*.

Pathetic right? Actually, what was more pathetic was that was never even good at it. I basically played the game from the morning to the night with little breaks. I would basically use League of Legends as a *substitute* for living my life. My social life suffered. My grades suffered. My body suffered. But worst of all, my sanity suffered.

I actually remember this one time when I was feeling super down so to cope with this, I played ranked matches until the sun was rising. Out of 6 games, 3 were wins and 3 were losses. I was at the **exact same place where I started**. Of course, I had school on the next day so I had to tough the entire day without any sleep. Fun right? It was on this day that I decided that I needed to quit.

###  How I quit
Nowadays I view video games as a waste of time. In my mind, if you play video games for more than two hours a day, you could probably use your energy on more productive tasks. 

I view video games *as a roadblock* that gets in the way of achieving my goals such as being a good student. This extends to my principles as a person: I strive to be as wasteless as possible and this extends to my time. I will not be one of those slobs that wastes their day playing video games all day.

**And thats the key: You have to view your addictions as obstacles getting in the way of what you want and also fundamentally against your principles.**

And you can't just say it, you have to *believe it*. If you truly believe it, you won't even *want* to feed your addictions. This is the most difficult step. Everything that follows will become easier.

## Separate yourself from your addictions.

> \>erm. but logan, how is this applicable to my heckin gooning seshes? I can't heckin control my sexual urges!!!

If you wish to quit something like pornography or masturbation, you have to make fundamental changes in your behaviour. When people say this, it really gives off the impression that they are saying that they have no control over their urges which is a really funny cope because your urges is actually one hundred percent controllable even with chemical addictions. You are not a victim of your own psychology.

Understand when and where you get an unresistable desire and avoid it. If you still go to bed with your phone next to you, *what do you really expect?* You're *going* to fail and it will be your fault. Similarily, if your soytok for you page is filled with half naked woman, *are you even serious about quitting?* Use your brain. Every time you fail, understand why and don't do it again.

### Stop making excuses!
They are useless whether they are true or not. Infact they are **counterproductive to quitting**. They are actually the worst thing you can do while trying to quit. Here's an example.
> \>but they make these things specifically to be addictive!

Sure, but are you *really* gonna let yourself admit that you've fallen for the tricks of Sam, 32, who has a soyence degree in social engineering? Are you one of those sheep that fall for simple psychology tricks?  Stop making excuses and actually focus up. It's actually more pathetic to make excuses for yourself than consciously relapsing. When you fail, it's your fault. Accept that.

### Stop self-identifying as an addict.
> \>I'm a porn addict and I don't know how to stop.

Self-identifed addicts are doomed to fail because they have tied their feet together before they have even began running. Why would you *self-identify* as something that you don't want to be? You are cucking yourself and subconsciously justifying your behavior. Would an aspiring entrepeneur *identify* with being lazy? No. Because that label is contrary to their goals. **You are not your addiction. Get an actual personality trait that you can be proud of.**

### Find new hobbies.
It should make sense that after you throw away your old hobbies, you should actively seek new ones. Replace addictive hobbies with healthy ones that actually develop skills and provide value in your life. If you fail to do this, you *will relapse* because you won't know how to spend all the extra time.

## A Message of Encouragement
I'm not saying that quitting is easy. But it's a simple process that you don't a degree in to succeed. It's not *hard*. If you keep your mind at it, you will be **guaranteed success**. Good luck out there!
