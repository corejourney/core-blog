## wasting my life away

One of the worst aspects of growing up is realizing that you've wasted so much time---time that you can't get back, simply because you made stupid mistakes that you can now no longer fix.

It feels weird. I'm never going to be a minor again. And to be honest, I'm quite disappointed in myself. I feel like I've done nothing with my life.

### stagnation

Before some oldhead comes and yells at me, yes I know that I'm not supposed to have figured out life at this stage. However, I feel that I should be good at *something*.

For all the activities and hobbies I've picked up over the years, I am not really amazing at any one of them. For example, I can claim that I have good grades, but I can't in good faith really claim that I'm a stellar student, when it's so clear that there are so many better students out there.

I've often felt that if I am not good at an activity or skill, I shouldn't even bother trying to improve or give myself a real chance. Ironically, this keeps me unskilled and stagnant. Isn't that funny?

### feeling like a loser

Having an inferiority complex is perhaps the worst mode of thinking you can ever have. Maybe it comes from growing up with tons of siblings and judgemental parents, but feeling, "inferior" has genuinely prevented me from doing so much. Here are some aspects about me that I believe results from feeling like a loser.

- Social Anxiety to the point where I'm unable to even speak like a normal human
- Being unable to stand up for myself
- People pleasing tendencies
- General appearance anxiety
- Just being insecure in my skills

And it's not in just these traits alone, it's really more how it seeps into everything I do... even something as insignificant as small talk is tainted by insecurity.

*This is embarassing to admit, but I've ruined so many friendships just because I felt like I didn't deserve to be around people.*

Paradoxically, improving myself in material ways does not help. Getting better grades and consistently practicing has **really done nothing for me.** I'm just as insecure as I was before I tried to "get better" and actually put some effort into living life.

### trying to get better

I guess the struggle is that it's internal? There's really no one forcing me to feel bad about myself or isolate from people for whatever reason.

I'm starting to question if self-confidence can really be internal and come from the self exclusively. I've really been aware of this problem for an embarassing amount of time. 

Or maybe confidence is just a myth. Who knows.
