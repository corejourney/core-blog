life always finds a way to disappoint me


<!-- 
- the bridge, taken down. 
  - the time i climbed it. no documentation. peace.
  - now its gone.
- emptiness of the modern world 
  - (bloor street west)
  - goals and the future
- teenager stuff (this too, will pass) 
  - anger
  - no more bridge,
  - identity
-->
