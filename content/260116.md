Sometimes in moments of perfect clarity, I wonder if I'm ever going to regret spending so much time thinking about nothing and thinking of being someone I could never be. I don't understand why I can't fully accept myself and just hang around peacefully like others do without meandering about thinking about 'moving onto the next stage of my life'. Feeling this, I remind myself these are just temporary after all. Tomorrow morning, just as today, I will wash my sullied face and live with a smile for yet another day.
