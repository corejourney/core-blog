{{< h3 id="no-center" >}}Some things about me.{{< /h3 >}}


My name is Zijing. I do not go by any other names. I was born in China on the month of March in 2007, and I grew up in a lonely house within the Greater Toronto Area (Canada). Despite this background I do not see myself as Chinese or Canadian. I am currently in post-secondary education, with the hope of becoming a doctor of medicine. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy school even as Science has 'fallen out' of my passion list. However, I would still regard myself a good student, but not good enough to be considered an academic powerhouse. I am absolutely fine with that assessment and I prefer that it stays that way.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the longest time I have learned Chinese as a hobby. I also have limited abilities in Korean and Latin. I would not claim native fluency in any of these languages. I can read novels in Chinese, intermediate texts in Korean and beginner texts in Latin. Turns out that learning any language is hard, but its always better to understand slightly more.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also enjoy writing, but mostly for myself. Although I do occasionally post them [here](/journal). I rarely write anything I'm proud of so don't expect common posts. Don't expect a theme either, the tone of the writings will probably flail around from personal to formal based on whatever I was feeling at the time.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also read [a decent amount](/books). (I believe I logged ~50 books in the year of 2025) I would describe my reading preference as favouring smaller, but not necessarily shorter, stories. My favourite English-language book is *The Waves* by Virginia Woolf, my favourite Chinese novel is *To Live* by Yu Hua, and my favourite manga is the *Goodnight Punpun* series.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some smaller interests I have dabbled in are: Rubiks Cube Solving, Chinese Calligraphy, Drawing (abs terrible at this atm), Programming (Basic HTML/CSS, Java, Python), [Photography](/mine), Hiking, Playing Video Games, Staying Informed on Politics, Music (Piano), and Music (Listening).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some fun facts about me. I have a twin sibling. I used to do sports (Guess which one!). My favourite colour is either blue or gray. My favourite food must be fried rice.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's more I could write about myself, but I'm not someone who deserves a biography.
