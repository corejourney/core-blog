{{< h3 id="no-center" >}}Some things about me.{{< /h3 >}}


I was born in China on the month of March in 2007, and I grew up in a lonely house within the Greater Toronto Area (Canada). Despite this background I do not see myself as Chinese or Canadian. I am currently in post-secondary education, with the hope of becoming a doctor of medicine. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy school even as Science has 'fallen out' of my passion list. However I would still regard myself a good student, but not good enough to be considered an academic powerhouse. I am absolutely fine with that assessment and I prefer that it stays that way.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the longest time I have learned Chinese as a hobby. I also have limited abilities in Korean and Latin. I would not claim native fluency in any of these languages. I can read novels in Chinese, intermediate texts in Korean and beginner-intermediate texts in Latin. Turns out that learning any language is hard, but its always better to understand slightly more.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also enjoy writing, but mostly for myself. Although I do occasionally post them [here](/journal). I rarely write anything I'm proud of so don't expect common posts. Nor a theme. The tags are there for the reader's (YOUR! ðŸ˜Š) benefit. I also read [a decent amount](/books). I would describe my reading preference as favouring smaller stories. My favourite English-language book is *The Waves* by Virginia Woolf, my favourite Chinese novel is *To Live*, and my favourite manga is the *Goodnight Punpun* series.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some smaller interests I have dabbled in (and enjoy) are: Rubiks Cube Solving, Chinese Calligraphy, Drawing (abs terrible at this atm), [Photography](/mine), Hiking, Playing Video Games, Films, Staying Informed on Politics, and Music (Listening).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's more I could write about myself, but I'm not someone who deserves a biography.
