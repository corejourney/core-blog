### stuff that i like doing

ㅤ

- **Reading:** self explanatory I guess. I enjoy both non fiction and fiction. List of books I own [here!!!](/library)

- **Language Learning:** I learn Chinese to not be a family embarassment and Korean because I thought the characters look cool once (true story)
	- I would love to start another language. Maybe Latin or Japanese?

- **Music:** I like distracting myself with music. I don't have a favourite music artist because I'm a coward that can't commit, but my top listened in 2024 was:

- **Nightwalking:** I love walking late at night because it is more peaceful. Also places tend to look more pretty at night anyways

- **Photography:** I like taking pictures of landscapes. Usually on said nightwalks. Yes, photos on this website are taken by me.

- **Programming:** this is something I definitely don't do very often anymore but i self-taught myself programming as a kid who spent too much time online. am i any good at it? no idea!

- **Writing/Journaling:** I definitely recommend just keeping a place to write down your thoughts and I must say it has helped me a lot. 

probably more but I can't think of any right now
