## Who am I?

I am an undergraduate student named Logan. I am interested in topics including Chemistry, Language, Medicine, Technology, Politics and Cryptocurrency. I hope to become an engineer eventually. 

## Purpose
My aim with this website is to write down thoughts that I can look back on in the future. Topics will range from technology, to medicine, language, personal matters, and social "commentary" if you can call rants that. I hope you enjoy and have a good day.
