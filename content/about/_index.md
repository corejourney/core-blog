## Purpose
My aim with this website is to write down thoughts that I can look back on in the future. I'll probably read some of what I write and think that I'm stupid, but who cares?

### Article ideas:
- Shut up about Passing
- Why everyone should own (some) monero
- Social Media cucks and it's consequences
- ðŸš†optics
- The silliness of modern transgenderism
- Stop using social media. Just stop it.
- Why I hate politics
- It's over, it was always over, and there's nothing I can do, and other silly lies.
