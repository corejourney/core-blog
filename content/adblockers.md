## internet ads are wasteful.

I would be mostly okay with advertising on the internet if it was even advertising useful products. 

However, you probably already know that 99% of ads are pushing some gimmick product or service that would probably be used once or twice before being discarded forever. Many advertisements are also so infuriating that it sometimes even ruins my mood completely.

Additionally, all the trackers, cookies and advertisments put on your laptop is legitimately insane. A page that should at most load in 1 second can take double, quintuple, eight times the amount time to load, which doesn't sound like much but can seriously slow down the speed in which the website loads, espicially if you have a slow internet connection. 

In fact, if you typically do not use an adblocker but come across a website with no advertisements (such as this one), you may be suprised at how fast it loads.

**seriously, as an internet user, no matter how casual, there's really no reason not to be doing this. you will be gaining so many hours of your life back.**

### what i use

- I made the effort to switch to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/)

#### Google Chrome is fine, but I believe they still do some suspicious advertisement tracker stuff anyways.

Additionally, I use these extensions

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) (!Works for Youtube!)
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/) (blocks those cookies popups when visiting sites)

If you are still unconvinced, this is how much ads were blocked after approximately three months of use.
