Everyone should own monero. You are in fact cucking yourself if you do not own monero, and through this article I hope to convince you to get some Monero for yourself.

## Why not Bitcoin?
Unlike what most "normies" **think** about cryptocurrencies, it is incorrect to describe cryptocurrencies as "anonymous hacker money", when in reality, many cryptocurrencies are extremely traceable. Bitcoin and similar currencies all have publicly available blockchains that track every single transaction that has ever been made in the bitcoin network. In a way, this is even worse than simply using a VISA credit card, because at least when you use a credit card, you transactions are not public for everyone to see.

**Therefore: if you want to continue buying the funny hormones on the internet, Bitcoin is not the currency you want to choose.**

### Bitcoin is not a viable currency of the future
In fact, a hypothetical future where Bitcoin becomes the de facto medium of exchange could prove a even bigger privacy disaster than the current financial present. A highly dedicated individual or group could easily determine sensitive information such as:
- Your account balance
- What you pay for, who you transact with (and I'm sure the IRS will love this!)
- Consumer privacy laws will essentially be moot due to the nature of a public blockchain

Bitcoin also comes with other baggage such as scalability issues with slow transactions, large transaction fees, and a fixed supply of bitcoin. All in all, it is clear that Bitcoin is not a viable as a global means of exchange.

## Monero
Monero, in short, **fixes all these issues**. Monero's blockchain technology obscures the transaction parties and transaction amounts. No outside observer can determine who you send money to, who you recieve money from, or how much you send/recieve. In short, it is Bitcoin but improved. It also fixes the issue of Bitcoin's scalability and high transaction fees. In fact, many online marketplaces that used to take Bitcoin are now slowly moving to use only Monero.

### Why own any cryptocurrency anyways?

If you are any individual concerned with internet and financial privacy, *which should be everyone* anyways, you need to own Monero. There really is no reason not to. In a centralised financial system like the present, you do not actually control your own money. That is an illusion. Your money can be taken at the whim of the government at any time. Am I saying to sell everything you own and convert it all to monero? Definitely not. But I believe it is beneficial for everyone to own some of it.
