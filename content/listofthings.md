- {{< h3 id="no-center">}}Too obssessed with relationships{{< /h3 >}}

It's not that serious. I promise.

- {{< h3 id="no-center">}}Doomers{{< /h3 >}}

If you're not familiar with what a doomer is, it's someone who has an extremely pessimistic and often fatalistic view toward life. You can indentify a doomer by commonly used phrases like *"It's over", "I'll never find love"* etc etc.

I'm really referring to a specific type of doomer here, not just someone who's depressed. I'm talking about someone who radiates their hopelessness onto everyone around them. They're people who really do enjoy being sad and miserable, and want others to think they're special for being a doomer. A sort of *"enlightened tortured soul"* if you will.

- {{< h3 id="no-center">}}"Nonchalant and Mysterious" people{{< /h3 >}}

Nonchalance only works if you've proved yourself to have valueable skills or abilities. It's weird if you're just some kid in high school.
