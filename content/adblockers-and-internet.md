## the internet is unusable 

The more I use the internet, the more it becomes obvious that it has become completely unusable.

It seems that no matter what you do, there seems to be an advertisement hiding in every link you press on the internet. Everyone's goal is attempting to sell products and it's just sickening. It's been a long time since content on the internet was not purely for monetary gain.

#### not to mention all the other problems that make it just annoying to use.

### internet ads are wasteful.

To be honest, I would be mostly okay with advertising on the internet if it was even advertising useful products. 

{{< figure src="/pics/adblockers-and-internet/horribleadvertisement.webp" class="caption_text" caption="This was the ad that really inspired me to write this article. I originally saw it on some random website. I bet that this ad would come off as slightly annoying for everyone." width="800px" height="auto" >}}

However, you probably already know that 99% of ads are pushing some gimmick product or service that would probably be used once or twice before being discarded forever. The ad itself may even be so infuriating that The money spent on internet advertising is quite wasteful ultimately.

Additionally, all the trackers, cookies and advertisments put on your laptop is legitimately insane. A page that should at most take one megabyte of bandwidth to load may **take up to eight megabytes**, which doesn't sound like much but can seriously slow down the speed in which the website loads, espicially if you have a slow internet connection. 

In fact, if you typically do not use an adblocker but come across a website with no advertisements (such as this one), you may be suprised at how fast it loads.

### use an adblocker!

Most people use an adblocker for the internet already. But if you haven't gotten to it yet, I promise you it will change your life, espicially if you are forced to use the internet as a job or otherwise.

- I made the effort to switch to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/) (Google Chrome tracks you)

Additionally, I use these extensions

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/) (blocks those cookies popups when visiting sites)

If you are still unconvinced, this is how much ads were blocked after approximately three months of use. Crazy right? (uBlock Origin, thankfully bypasses Youtube adblock detection)
