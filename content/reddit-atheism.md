Meet the Reddit Atheist.

![redditathiest](/pics/beautifulatheist.jpg)

Here's what he kind of looks like. If you talk to him IRL, he may come off as socially awkward, unaware, or even weird. You may even believe that he is the nerdy smart type. But no. He is something so much different.

## well, what are reddit atheists?

Despite the name, they are not only found on reddit. But they are actually everywhere if you look hard enough! Here are some of the traits that I see many of them sharing.

### superiority complexes

Reddit Atheists, in my opinion, all share one trait that unite them all: superiority complexes. A superiority complex is a mindset that some people develop to mask their deep feelings of self-inferiority. Even if you have never heard of this term before, you have definitely met someone with this mentality before. It usually presents as a constant need to belittle others or to feel superior to others.

The Reddit Atheist will look at you like you have insulted the holy god of science if you choose to believe in a god. If you are brave enough to have a discussion on religion, get ready for the quippy rhetorical remarks he has learned from the mountains of "How to debate a theist" videos he regularly consumes on Youtube. But normally, if you suspect that one is a reddit atheist, it is best not to engage with religious discussion at all.

Don't fall for the meme people, atheist types who supposedly believe in "reason" and "logic" are usually **no smarter than the average person**.

### they are really, really, annoying

Reddit Atheists can't resist commenting or preaching their beliefs whenever the topic of religion is brought up. Whether it be during a Christian family saying grace or a post about greiving for a loved one, you can bet on the reddit atheist say some snarky line about "logic" or "reason". Here are some of my favourite terms/lines.

- *sigh* - followed by an extremely condescending arguement
- Religious people are literally all **indoctrinated** into their religion
- Referring to god as "sky daddy" or "flying spaghetti monster"
- Refers to all religions as **cults**
- Refers to all scripture as **fairy tales**
- That one Karl Marx Quote

### anti-religious, for some reason?

It is without saying that this type of atheist is usually from America or European countries. These countries tend to have powerful religious institutions that have major influence over the population in which they live. Many of these institutions are corrupt and oppressive and many of these reddit atheists have taken this to mean that **all** forms of religion are evil and oppressive, as if religion is a fundamentally evil thing.

If you do not believe me, read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1gpuibv/religion_needs_to_be_eradicated/) and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1gpys74/humanity_would_be_better_off_without_religion/) to understand what I mean. (Oh yeah, r/atheism is usually where they all congregate)

### Extremely un self aware

The Reddit Atheist is not aware of what he comes off as, because he is too busy circlejerking with his atheist friends about how intelligent they are. This can be represented in this gem, which completely ruined the image of reddit forever.

> "Just to be clear, I'm not a professional 'quote maker'. I'm just an atheist teenager who greatly values his intelligence and scientific fact over any silly fiction book written 3,500 years ago. This being said, I am open to any and all criticism.

> 'In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god's blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence.'"

## what can we learn from the reddit atheist?

### how is a reddit atheist made?

A deep feeling of inferiority, coupled with a lack of self-care, social awareness, combined with a lethal amount of time spent online. Therefore, with nothing else to hold onto, they hold onto their "intelligence" to feel superior to religious people.

The lesson is as it always is. **Spend less time online and more time in real life!**

** Personally, I feel embarassed that I even spent enough time on the internet to know what a reddit atheist is.

### final words

I personally think the "Reddit Atheist" archetype is extremely fascinating. How chronic internet usage have created a large portion of internet atheists that talk all in the same way.

Honestly, the only difference between Reddit Atheists from a normal, chill atheist is just respect. Normal atheists will definitely disagree with religious people but most will not care enough to "debate" religiousity or really care to belittle religious people because of their views. So, if you are a reddit atheist watching this, here are some simple substitutions you can employ in your every day speech to *not* out yourself as some weirdo.

- "There is no god" → "I do not believe in a god"
- "I do not believe in fairy tales" →  "I do not believe in any scripture"
- "Religion is nonsense, ignorant and outdated" →  "I do not believe in a religion"

#### This is going to be the last post in a while where I talk about some weird inane internet phenonmenon. Yes, I'm aware that I am quite a hypocrite.

Have a good night!
