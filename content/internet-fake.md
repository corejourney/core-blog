Many people make the mistake of attempting of trying to find emotional support and community on the internet when that is one of the worst things you can use the internet for. The more I use the internet, the more I realize how awful it is for users and their mental health. 

## the internet sucks for human interaction

Everything on the internet sucks for human interaction. Instagram, Twitter, *REDDIT*, 4chan, all promote a terrible weird parasocial type of communication. (Yes, everyone on the internet is a loser). All these platforms are cringe and toxic.

It's not exactly the platforms that's the problem, either. It's the people. Incessant arguing about the most useless things is common. Trolls whose purpose is to make peoples lives worse is also common. You will never find people as weird as they are on the internet. Of course, this is probably because the 'outcasts' of society tend to congregate on the internet. 

### fake friends

A major problem of using the internet so much is that you start to develop parasocial relationships whether you like it or not. Whether it's an Instagram page you follow, a Twitter account you follow, or a Youtube channel, you will start feeling attached to people who you do not know.

And that is not exactly your fault. Many of these creators purposely portray themselves as friendly and share aspects of their life. If you consume enough of this content you will inevitable form an attachment. However, it is important to realize that these attachments harm you. How much they affect your life is ultmately up to you. 

### the internet will make you miserable and insecure.

The internet will make you miserable because of the amount of other miserable people who use it regularly. **People on the internet seemlyingly feed on misery.** Constant complaining. Hate comments for no reason. Go on any platform and scroll for 10 minutes and see how long it takes to find a needless hate comment. Everyone on the internet is there to circlejerk about their pain and make it worse.

**If you take nothing else from this entry, remember that happy people don't use the internet!**

The internet will make you insecure and that is intentional. Follow new trends. Learn the new slang. Don't wear that. Wear that type of shirt. Running totally makes you look pathetic dood! Men who ____ are so pathetic!!!! Women who ____ are so stupid!!! 

Human brains were never meant to be able to get access to this amount other peoples opinions, much less about other people. You will get new insecurities if you consume the internet whether you like it or not.

## Get off the internet!

All of this to say: get off the internet! Go talk to your friends! Go on a walk! Anything to avoid allowing yourself to be worse by using social media. As someone who used to be very addicted to the internet, my life has gotten significantly better as I decided to completely cut down on internet time, in a definitely causational relationship. Here are some tips that I used to quit easily.

1. Don't bring your phone everywhere with you. Put it somewhere hard to reach also.
2. Delete every social media on the phone. I don't even feel the need to grab my phone anymore because I know there is nothing on there.
3. Find new hobbies to fill up the newfound boatload of time.

It really is that easy. **You will be bored as you start weaning yourself off the internet**. But it will be worth it! I promise!

Good day.
