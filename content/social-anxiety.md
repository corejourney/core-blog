## "just talk more dude"

This is a phrase that really upsets me, and not just because it's a dismissive statement.

My problem with this "advice" is that it demonstrates a lack of empathy or understanding on "normal" people's side. As I have been told this basically everytime I have opened up about social anxiety, I thought I would try to explain what having it feels like.


### what social anxiety feels like

**I would describe having social anxiety as being in a constant downward spiral.**

For me, sometimes the mere thought of having a conversation with someone is enough to make my heart beat fast and feel dizzy. Sometimes I have the willpower or energy to get through it and even come off normal, but many times people can tell the "weird vibes" that radiate from this state of anxiety.

> I'm sure that if you know what I'm talking about, you know the "you're giving weird vibes" eyes have been burned into your memory.

Because of the amount of effort it takes to simply imitate being normal, I often question if it's even worth *trying* to be normal.

## thoughts on social isolation

When I meet someone who doesn't really have a social circle, I can pretty much quickly tell if they choose not to socialize by choice or if they just have crippling social anxiety. The difference between these two groups is actually quite simple

**they have high self confidence!** 

Contrary to popular belief, calling yourself an "introvert" does not mean that you get nervous when ordering food or that you get dizzy from having a normal conversation. This may be suprising if you do know me in person, but I am a natural extrovert. It is in my opinion that social anxiety was a condition that I developed as I aged. People are not "born" with social anxiety, and I know for a fact that I wasn't.

Fact is, social isolation is really a self-imposed prison. If I really think about it, making friends is not super difficult. You don't even have to be a really interesting or even good person to have a social system either. 

But social isolation is a prison that can seem impossible to get out of. Really, a variety
