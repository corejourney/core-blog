When I was younger, I was quite a loud and outgoing child. I yelled and screamed at any inconvenience and made friends quite easily. I usually think back on the few memories I still have of these years fondly, as this was the last time I felt that I truly had friends.

### developing social anxiety

For middle school, I was forcefully moved (asian parents lol) to a private Catholic middle school.

**I have no idea how I got in anyways, I had no interest in any white boy sports, sports in general, or good at studying at all**

Needlessly to say, I did not mesh in well with the other kids. I pretty much went from having a good amount of friends to having none. This really messed with my head, and after the blessing which was the COVID-19 pandemic, I had pretty much stopped knowing how to interact with people entirely.

### what social anxiety feels like

**I would describe having social anxiety as being in a constant downward spiral.**

For me, sometimes the mere thought of having a conversation with someone is enough to make my heart beat fast and feel dizzy. Sometimes I have the willpower or energy to get through it and even come off normal, but many times people can tell the "weird vibes" that radiate from this state of anxiety.

And after trying to be social, I often question if it's even worth
