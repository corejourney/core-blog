### Warning: Useless Complaining

Everyday, I pray for some god to free me from the shackles known as social anxiety. It is perhaps the most pathetic, embarassing things about me.

Imagine being a fully grown adult (me) and struggling to interact with people on any capacity. How embarassing would that be? 

I remember once sitting beside a guy in middle school and struggling to simply start a conversation about the show that he was watching. I sat there stupidly for five minutes in an uncomfortable silence before I gave up and moved seats. My social life is filled with stories like this. Nowadays, it seems like I only talk if someone decides to start conversation with me.

I know that I need to work on it myself. But I just don't. It's not that I have nothing to talk about, it is simply that I get too nervous.

**I'm scared of everyone I talk to. Even family. It also makes me bad at making friends.**

I should really just lock in, shouldn't I...
