From today onwards, I will no longer be using any profanities.

## Why?
Because they're often not needed to express my opinion on anything. I do not enjoy the image it produces of me nor the perception it creates of me. This is not for spiritual or religious reasons but more for the image I want to build for myself, someone who is not overly emotional, espicially over minor events.
