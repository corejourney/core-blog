2025 was the year where I finally decided to "lock in" and start reading for real. So this year was mostly a question of determining the type of books I actually liked reading. (In chronological order)

(Did Not Finish is not an evaluation on the books quality)

### The Drug Hunters (Kirsch, Donald)

I technically read this in December, but I included it because I thought it was fitting.

Drug Hunters is a book about medicine. Specifically, how new drugs are discovered, researched, and then released to the general public. It goes over the history of this practice, the discovery of crucial drugs such as acetaminophen, and the various problems that plague the industry.

The key insight that can be gathered from this book is that there is no real "method" when researching new drugs. The most popular drugs ever on the market were usually a result of dumb luck, (as is the case with penicillin), or alternatively, just modifications of an existing drug. As someone who was curious about pharmacology generally, I found these insights valueable, and also turned me off from pursuing this field of research generally, espicially with considering how new drugs are actually approved, and which get funding from pharmaceutical companies, which are topics also covered within the text.

I recommend reading this book if you're interested in how new drugs and treatments are researched (discovered), or if you want a crash course into the history of pharmaceuticals generally.

### 活着 (余华)

我当时读这本书的时候是先想练习我的读中文的能力，并且更丰富了解中国文学方面的书。

“*活着*” 是我很久以来读的第一本书。因为我是在加拿大长大的，我读中文的时候会有一些困惑。（写文件也会有困惑 😄）但是令我吃惊的是，我读这本书其实没有什么大困难。

这个小说是一个忧伤和悲惨的故事。要是你读过这本书的话，这点你肯定知道。从这本书中，我得到很多启发。不仅有历史方面的，还有情感方面的。就算读不了中文，我推荐你读。 （好像一定会有英文版）

This is a deeply tragic and sad novel. Set in the midst of the transition from the Kuomintang to the Communist Party, it is about the story of Fugui. He is the son of a landlord turned peasant, and we follow the various misfortunes throughout his life. If you've read this before, you of course know this. 

Even if you are not Chinese, I think that it is worth reading. It is more about human tragedy, and how ordinary persevere through them, than anything else. (I believe there are English versions). 

### Leo Tolstoy's Short Stories

#### How Much Land Does A Man Need?

A funny short story about an overzealous wealthy peasant who ruins his life by chasing better and bigger plots of land. He finds out in the end that he didn't need much land at all.

#### What Men Live By

A little heavy on the Christian religious messaging but I still found it extremely sweet. It is about a peasant family taking care of a mysterious stranger, and learning the three things on which men live by (as described in the title).

*It's more like a fairy tale than an actual story in some parts but who cares, I liked it.*

### The Republic (Plato)

Not much really to say here. It's *Republic* by Plato. It's probably the first Socratic dialogue (Socratic = based and big brained, others = owned by Socrates) one thinks of when such a topic comes up.

It covers topics like the **nature of justice**, **the ideal city-state**, and just generally how to be "just". And this is the text where the famous **allegory of the cave** appears.

One problem I had when reading was that I felt that some parts were really hard to understand, but maybe that's because this is my first real philosophy text, so that point's on me. Another problem was that I thought many of the ideas proposed were weirdly authoritarian. Like Socrate's tirade against imitative art and imperfect protagonists.

*Perhaps Plato's worldview is so different to how modern society is structured that I instinctively felt repulsion and refused to honestly engage with the ideas put forward.*

I have no idea if I'm going to revisit this text, but I thought that it was an okay read. Maybe my reflection on this piece has outed me as an uneducated drone who can't read words correctly. (But honestly, it doesn't really matter)

Read if you are generally interested in western philosophy and can stomach some repetitiveness.

### Meditations (Marcus Aurelius)

This text was never meant to be read by other audiences, and I think this is quite evident from the whole format of the book. It's heavy on repetition and borders on insufferable at times. But I think there's tidbits of wisdom in the book.

Overall, I think the main insights of the book can be summarised as such:

1. Life is short (and therefore fame is useless)
2. Death isn't a big deal (But make sure to bring this up every single page)
3. Accept your place in the world, no matter what that place is (pretty easy for an emperor to say)
4. Do things according to NATURE
5. Don't mind others opinions

There are other "entries" that were also quite nice, but overall, it felt more like the affirmation journal of an emperor who might be projecting just a little bit. It didn't help that the edition I read used royal English so it made for a difficult read. 

### Empire of Pain (Keefe, Patrick)

Written by Patrick Keefe, a journalist of the New York Times, *Empire of Pain* dives into the history of the Sackler family, Purdue Pharma, and how they made billions from the opioid crisis.

I 100% did not give this one an actual chance. I just could not stomach reading 200 pages about Arthur Sackler and the book lowkey glazing him. It constantly calls him a "genius" which annoyed me to no end. I went in expecting to learn more about Purdue Pharma, not the life story of some probably insufferable rich guy with strange interests. This is the only book I have stopped reading simply from slight pettiness.

### The Handmaid's Tale (Atwood, Margaret)

*The Handmaid's Tale* is Margaret Atwood's most famous dystopian novel. It's about a future where the previous American regime has been overthrown in favour of a puritan authoritarian type government, where an infertility crisis forces the only last few fertile women to be locked in a facility, where they are forced to be raped, stripped of autonomy, as part of the Gileadean regime's rabid desire for childbirth.

Throughout this book, Atwood uses the society of Gilead to bring up problems such as women's autonomy, abortion and the control of sexuality in women. The bulk of this book is primarily focused on the observations of Offred (Of-fred), and the suffering that she endures in this horribly repressive society.

I think the topics brought up in this story are quite valuable, and done quite well, but it's quite lacking in actual events or character development. While I'm sure this was done as an intentional choice, I would say don't start reading expecting some kind of action packed revolution, because that is not what this book is about.

### Crime and Punishment (Dostoevsky, Fyodor)

*Crime and Punishment* is perhaps Dostoevsky's most famous novel. It follows Raskolnikov, a smart but financially destitute student who murders an old pawnbroker. He expects to become "great", but he in reality, suffers greatly throughout the book.

While I found the psychological and philosophical aspects of the book valuable, I feel that much of the dialogue was overwritten and hard to follow. Characters also sometimes act in a strange and inexplicable ways, like randomly getting up in the middle of a conversation and moving a chair across the room, or something of that nature. This just completely made me like the story a lot less.

Along with this being my first Russian novel I've read, it just lead to a confusing and slow read. For example, the main character, Rodion Raskolnikov, is referred to as *Rodion* in some situations, *Raskolnikov* or "*Romanovich*" in others, and *Rodia* by his family. This is the case for much of the other characters in the story as well. (Of course, this confusion might be due to a deficiency in my knowledge of Russian).

Finally, I felt that there weren't a lot of events or plot points throughout the entire story. There were a handful of high intensity moments, but I must say I was quite bored throughout the most of it.

Perhaps I'll give it another chance one day. 

### White Nights (Dostoevsky, Fyodor)

The OG nice guy short story. A man gets brutally friend zoned by a girl that might be too young for the entire book and ends unexpectedly. I'm not going to go into the plot any further because I believe that'll ruin the experience for any potential readers... :)

I'm not going to lie. I closed this book with a smile with how weirdly sweet it was.

### No Longer Human (Dazai, Osamu)

The title directly translated from its Japanese original is *A Human Failure*. And honestly, I think that *A Human Failure* is a far more fitting title, because that is what the protagonist of the story, Yozo, precisely is. A semi auto-biographical novel, *No Longer Human* covers themes of alienation, depression and the fear of divine punishment.

If you enjoy reading about an insanely mentally damaged man who exploits every woman who ever has the misfortune of encountering him, while also somehow being the most self-loathing person ever (or you just *are* this kind of person, or maybe just relate to this kind of person), you will probably love reading this book.

A lot of negative reviews I've seen of this book has been focused on Yozo's behaviour itself. It's obvious that Yozo is a horrible, maybe insufferable person. It can be plainly seen by the way he wallows in misery, never improves his ways and is an obvious misogynist. However, it is obvious that he is not supposed to be an aspirational character, espicially with the context given in the epilogue. 

Osamu Dazai himself probably wrote Yozo as a sort of self insert, with this entire novel clearly being extremely personal to him. Dazai eventually died in a double suicide with his lover at the time, after multiple similar attempts. This is much like the attempted double suicide depicted within the story.

Personally, this book left me with a strange sensation of pity for the protagonist, while at the same time relating somewhat since I've dealt with feelings of loneliness and alienation as well. All in all, it's quite sad to see someone who is seemingly doomed to suffer, even if the suffering is mostly self-imposed, and I think it can be very relatable for everyone, even if you aren't *that* far gone yet.

Read this book if you're in the mood for a depressing and slightly frustrating experience. (And if you can stomach the misogyny, of course).

### Being Mortal (Gawande, Atul)

*Being Mortal*, is a medical memoir which focuses on the topic of death, and what happens in cases where death is unavoidable. As you may expect, this memoir focuses on a lot of cases surrounding terminal illness, and generally on "end-of-life" care.

The main conflict, or issue this memoir brings up is the question of balance in the medical system in end of life situations. Often, when a patient is faced with a terminal illness, the priority is often put on prolonging survival rather than ensuring good quality of life until death. Gawande questions if **prolonging life is worth the potential suffering it can bring**. With this question, *Being Mortal* asks the reader, "What should be the ultimate goal of medicine when chances of survival after treatment are extremely low?".

This book also brings up nursing homes and their problems, particularly focusing on how these homes often make residents depressed and without purpose. It also goes into the history of alternatives, such as assisted living homes and Eden Living.

I left this book with a new perspective on death and what the role of medicine *should* be in our lives. It also caused me to reevaluate my priorities in life, as it correctly points out that we all must confront our mortality someday, no matter how much time is really left.

I would recommend this book if you are interested in topic surrounding end-of-life care, medicine, and more generally, death.

### The Bell Jar (Plath, Sylvia)

This book is roughly split into two parts. The first is about her life in the fashion industry and college life, and the second is about her actual mental breakdown.

I think that Slyvia Plath has a very distinctive voice, and I definitely enjoyed her writing style. I also thought that her depiction of 1960s America is quite competent.

The book was quite okay. First of all, the first half of the book was just kind of boring. I definitely thought the second part was miles more interesting than the first. However, I can excuse that as I have definitely read more monotonous material.

One aspect of the book that I was not expecting was the constant casual racism.

> Then my ears went funny, and I noticed a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring idiotically into my face. It was only me, of course. I was appalled to see how wrinkled and used-up I looked. (Chapter 2)
