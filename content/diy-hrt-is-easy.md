**Here's a hard truth: There are almost no excuses for not being on HRT if you are of legal age**

## A collection of silly excuses
> **But it's illegal!**

This assertion is *only half-true* if you want testosterone. But it is *completely incorrect* if you want estrogen. There is no legal risk in virtually any country of purchasing estradiol or its derivatives because it is not a controlled substance.

> **But.. but.. testosterone is a controlled substance!â„¢**

**Let me ask you a question:** Have you *ever* heard of a case of a gym rat getting caught with testosterone? Have you heard of someone being *persecuted* for testosterone possession? No. Because that never happens. In fact, many bodybuilders speak openly about using steroids. If you are only buying or possessing testosterone, you are in fact in very little to no legal danger.

> **But I'm broke and don't have enough money!!!**

**DIY is relatively cheap**. ~100 dollars USD for a year of injections. Get a job or sell something you own.

> **But I'm scared of syringes!**

This one is definitely the weirdest one to me. Do you think if you were diagnosed with diabetes you would use this excuse? Stop *denying yourself* bodily autonomy just because of a fear you can get over easily. 

> **But.. it's dangerous!**

This is only true in the sense that every time you inject something inside your body, you run the risk of something going wrong. There are hundreds, thousands of anecdotal reports of people on DIY hormones, yet something going horribly wrong is unheard of.

### A short rant
Reading justifications of not being able to be on HRT really frustrates me in a *fundamental* level because it's so easy. Really when people bring up all these justifications about not starting, they either have not done any research or seem to want to be cucked by the medical system that *explicitly* gatekeeps essential medicine from you. Have some urgency and take control of your body before it's too late.

# Obtaining Hormones

**Note: I am not an expert in endocrinology or the best practices in dosing or which ester to choose. This article will not cover these topics.**

## Picking a source
For people seeking out estrogen, [hrtcafe.net](https://hrtcafe.net) has a good and constantly updating source list. For those who are seeking out testosterone, check out [eroids.com](https://www.eroids.com/) for a source list in your respective region. I cannot confirm the quality of any of the sources found. It is up to you to conduct further research.

## Obtaining Cryptocurrency
I've found the biggest reason why people are turned off by the idea of DIY HRT is the cryptocurrency requirement. In reality, it is not that hard. An hour at most and you'll understand what you need to know about it.

### What currency do I use?

In my mind, there are really only three viable currencies you should consider.
- **Bitcoin:** The "OG" cryptocurrency.
  - Pros:
    - Almost all vendors take Bitcoin
    - Easily has the largest volume of guides and information
  - Cons:
    - HIGH transaction fees.
    - Slow transaction speeds (A typical transaction takes 20 minutes *at least*)
    - A public blockchain means that you could theortically be tracked
- **Litecoin:** a bitcoin alternative.
  - Pros:
    - Most vendors take also Litecoin
    - Low transaction fees
    - Fast transactions (3-5 minutes)
  - Cons:
    - Public blockchain means that you could theortically be tracked
- **Monero:** the most popular privacy-coin.
  - Pros:
    - Most vendors take Monero
    - Low Transaction fees
    - Fast Transactions (3-5 minutes)
    - Transactions are untrackable out of the box.
  - Cons:
    - Harder to obtain due to regulations
    - Can be harder to use

### What wallet do I use?

For Bitcoin, I recommend the [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/) as it is beginner friendly and open source. For Litecoin, I recommend [electrum-ltc](https://electrum-ltc.org/) for the same reason. For Monero, you can either use the official [monero wallet](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/) or the [feather wallet](https://featherwallet.org/) for an experience closer to electrum.

Make sure to read documentation, learn how to send/recieve transactions. **Make sure to guarantee that you send/recieve at the right address. All transactions are irreversible in cryptocurrencies**.

### Buying Crypto With ID / KYC

[Choose one of the many crypto exchanges.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=crypto+exchanges+list) There is simply too much to list. All of these services require you to be at the age of majority in your respective country/state. However, this is probably the cheapest option. **Remember: do not keep your crypto in the exchanges custodial wallets. You do not actually own any crypto unless it's in a hard wallet where you control the private key.**

### Buying Crypto Without ID / Anonymously

If you for some reason do not have access to a valid ID, there are services such as [LocalCoinSwap](https://localcoinswap.com/), [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) and [Robosats](https://dex.robosats.com/) where you can choose a payment method of your choice, including cash. If those options do not work for you, many places offer [Cryptocurrency ATMs](https://coinatmradar.com/) that usually do not ask for ID and take cash as payment. Note that non-KYC methods tend to be more expensive than centralised exchanges, and charge a premium. 

### Things to consider

- All transactions are *final* with cryptocurrencies. Make sure you are both sending and receiving at the right address.
- The price of cryptocurrencies are **famously unstable**, so I'd recommend buying cryptocurrency shortly before purchasing or overbuying just to be safe.

## Preventing Package Interception
Some people are naturally concerned about their package being intercepted. If you are concerned with this possibility, consider using a Post Office Box. They are cheap for a small package that only holds the vial. Alternatively, send it to an address of a person you trust. Most vendors offer discrete shipping so as long as you trust this party enough to not open your package, you should be good.

Syringes for injecting can be found on Amazon. You can use Amazon's lockers to pick up discretely and prevent any chance of package interception. Buy amazon gift cards with cash if you do not want such purchase to show up in bank statements.

I hope I've given you a start to obtaining hormones. If you have any cryptocurrency left over after, please convert it into monero and [consider donating](/support/). Any amount is appreciated. Adios!
